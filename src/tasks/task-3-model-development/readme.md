# Summary

  This task mostly comprised of the Model evaluation of the dataset provided by the feature-extraction and the EDA
  team. The model is trained using RNN and LSTM models to give a better accuracy.
  
  The task-3-model-development folder contains the notebooks of various colaborators who have worked on the LSTM model evaluation:
  - basic model - Ksenia Trusova
  - 3-layer LSTM configuration - Vishu Kalier
  - 1-layer LSTM configuration - Yirui Zhu
  - 2-layer LSTM configuration - Nisha Menon
