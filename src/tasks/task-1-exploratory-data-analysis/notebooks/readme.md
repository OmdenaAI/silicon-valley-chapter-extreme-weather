# Notebook Guidelines

 -  Please keep the notebook for the EDA in this folder only.
 -  The notebook should be well justified with markdown cells and comments explaining the intuition to the viewers.
 -  Keep the visualizations neat and proper.
 -  If the file size is too large for direct upload then please upload it on google drive first and then provide the specified google drive link.
