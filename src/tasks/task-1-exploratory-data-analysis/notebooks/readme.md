All the colaborators of the task-1-exploratory-data-analysis are requested to adhere to the below guidelines to the maximum extent possible.

# Notebook Guidelines

 -  Please keep the notebook for the EDA in this folder only.
 -  The notebook should be well justified with markdown cells and comments explaining the intuition to the viewers.
 -  Keep the visualizations neat and proper.
 -  If the file size is too large for direct upload then please upload it on google drive first and then provide the specified google drive link. You can also provide the direct link to the notebook via colboratory as well.


    In case of any doubts or queries please feel free to ask the task-lead without hesitation.
