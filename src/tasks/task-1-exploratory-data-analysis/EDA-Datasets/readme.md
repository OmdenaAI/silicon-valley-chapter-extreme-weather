# $${\color{lightblue}EDA \space Datasets \space Subfolder}$$
    Here all the pre-processed and the splitted datasets for the task-1-exploratory data analysis, can be
    placed by any collaborator. The Feature-extraction team is supposed to work on these pre-processed 
    datasets provided in these subfolders.


# $${\color{lightblue} Guidelines \space For \space Uploading}$$
1- Since, the <b><i>dataset will be split according to various parameters</i></b>, if one is working on any particular parameter, then the collaborator should create a folder within this EDA Dataset <b><i>folder with a name of the parameter</i></b> on which he/she has splitted the Original dataset. For eg: If you are splitting the dataset on the basis of seasons then create a sub-folder with the name "Seasons" and add all the required pre-processed files to the specific sub-folder.

2- Please upload the <b><i>correct pre-processed datasets</i></b> in the given subfolder, if the subfolder is not created as per your parameters and create one.

3- <b><i>No duplicate subfolders</i></b> are allowed.

4- Only provide the datasets in this subfolder, and not the notebooks. Notebooks should be uploaded in the <b><i>'Notebooks'</i></b> sub-folder.

5-  <b><i>Please do not be hasty in uploading notebooks</i></b> or datasets, have a look at the guidelines and if in case of discrepanies or issues ask the Task Leader directly.
Please upload your work in the correct folders after double checking the folder and its sub-directories.

All Collaborators are requested to update the task-table whenever anything is uploaded. In case if the collaborator is not able to update the task-table then it will be
manually updated on <b><i>weekends (Sunday)</i></b> by the <b><i>Task Leader</i></b>.
