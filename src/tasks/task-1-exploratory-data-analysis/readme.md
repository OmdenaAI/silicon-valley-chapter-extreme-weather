This is the readme.md file. The task-1-exploratory-data-analysis folder contains the notebooks of various colaborators who have worked on EDA and the entire summarized report of the task.

# ${Description}$

      The folder contain three sub folders, one for the notebooks named as notebooks folder and second one for the report named as
      report folder and third one for uploading the EDA Datasets by the collaborators as the EDA Datasets subfolder.




# ${General \space Guidelines}$

 1- Please upload the notebook in the <b><i>specified notebooks folder only.</i></b> Please do not upload <b><i>incomplete notebooks</i></b>.
  
 2- The tasks and the contributions of every collaborator are provided in the table below and is manually updated on <b><i>Weekends (Sunday)</i></b> by the <b><i>Task-Leader </i></b>.
 
 3- The task-1 comprises of visualizations and Exploratory-data-analysis, since after the EDA the shape of the dataset may change due to truncation of irrelevant columns so if any collaborator wishes to update his/her pre-processed file <b><i>upload it in the EDA datasets subfolder</i></b> in the task-1-exploratory-data-analysis folder.
 
 4- The Report will be avaialable and updated in the <b><i>specified report folder</i></b> for the task-1-exploratory-data-analysis.
 



The general Task Updates are provided in the table below.
